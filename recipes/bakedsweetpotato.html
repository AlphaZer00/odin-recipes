        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>We enjoy sweet potatoes year round, but when fall hits,
             it’s really their time to shine. They’re a total superfood
             (packed with vitamin C and fiber), are delicious sweet or
             savory, and can add color and variety to your plate. You can
             roast them, mash them, air fry them… the possibilities are
             endless. One of our favorite ways to prepare them is to bake
             them whole in the oven. It’s also arguably the simplest
             (only the microwave might have it beat), and the most
             versatile. Check out our easy instructions below for baking
             perfect ones every time.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>4 sweet potatoes, scrubbed clean</li>
                <li>Olive oil, optional</li>
                <li>4 tbsp. butter</li>
                <li>Kosher salt</li>
                <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 425º. On a baking sheet lined with
                 aluminum foil, prick sweet potatoes all over with a fork.
                 Rub the outsides with a small amount of olive oil if you
                 intend to eat the skins.</li>
                <li>Bake until tender, 45 to 50 minutes.</li>
                <li>Let cool, then split the tops open with a knife and
                 top with a pat of butter.</li>
                <li>Season with salt and pepper before serving.</li>
            </ol>
